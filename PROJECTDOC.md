##HTML Structure (Semantic HTML5):

The overall structure uses <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>.
Blog posts within the "Blog" and "Home" pages are structured using <article> and <section> elements.
Content sections within pages also use <section>.
Lists (<ul>, <li>) are used for navigation items and feature lists.
Forms (<form>, <label>, <input>, <textarea>, <button>) are used for the contact page.
Headings (<h1> to <h3>) are used hierarchically.
Images (<img>) are used for the slider and post thumbnails (using placehold.co for placeholders).
Links (<a>) are used for all navigation.

##CSS3 Styling (Tailwind CSS & Custom CSS):

Tailwind CSS: Provides utility classes for rapid, responsive styling. This handles most of the layout, typography, colors, spacing, and responsiveness.
Custom CSS (within <style> tags):
Sets the "Inter" font for the body.
Styles for the active navigation link.
Basic styles for the image slider (.slider-container, .slide, .active).
Styles for the mobile hamburger menu visibility.
Error styling for form validation.
A custom, non-blocking message box to replace alert().
JavaScript for Interactivity:

##Page Navigation Simulation:
The pages object holds the HTML content for each "page".
The loadPage(pageName) function dynamically injects the content of the selected page into the <main id="mainContent"> element.
Navigation links (.nav-link and other .site-link elements with data-page attributes) trigger loadPage.
The URL hash (#pagename) is updated on navigation and used to handle browser back/forward buttons and direct linking.
Mobile Navigation:
A hamburger menu button toggles the visibility of the mobile navigation menu (#mobileMenu).
Image Slider (Home Page):
The initImageSlider() function (called when the home page is loaded) controls a simple fading image slider. It cycles through images with the class .slide within .slider-container.
Contact Form Validation (Contact Page):
The initContactForm() function sets up event listeners for the contact form.
validateForm() and validateField() functions handle client-side validation for:
Required fields (name, email, subject, message).
Valid email format.
Error messages are displayed next to the respective fields.
On successful validation, a success message is shown using the custom message box, and the form is reset.
Custom Message Box:
showMessage(title, message) function displays a custom modal dialog instead of using the browser's alert().
Dynamic Footer Year: The current year in the footer is updated automatically.
Responsiveness:

Achieved primarily through Tailwind CSS utility classes (e.g., md:flex, grid-cols-2, lg:grid-cols-3, px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8).
The navigation bar collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
Content layouts (like blog post grids) adjust to screen width.
